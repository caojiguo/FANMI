# This repository consists of the code for replicating the simulation studies in the manuscript entitled "Generalized Functional Additive Nonlinear Models with Multimodal Interaction Effects"  

1. Sim1.R : In this file, we give the R code of the simulation study 1. In this code, we explore the performance of proposed estimators.

2.Sim2.R : In this file, we give the R code of the simulation study 2. In this code, we show the performance of our goodness of fit test to evaluate whether the component functions within our model are constants.

3.Sim3.R : In this file, we give the R code of the simulation study 3. In this code, we show the performance of the interaction test to examine whether the bivariate component functions in our model can be reduced to univariate functions.
